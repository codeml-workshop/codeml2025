# **C**hampioning **O**pen-source **De**velopment in **M**achine **L**earning

Open-source software development is a cornerstone of modern machine learning research.
However, there are often overlooked issues around the
sustainability of long-term projects, the reliability of software,
and proper academic acknowledgment of long-term maintenance and contributions.
The CODEML workshop at [ICML](https://icml.cc/) aims to identify and discuss strategies for successful and sustainable open-source development
in machine learning while also proposing possible solutions to the challenges mentioned above.
In addition, this workshop will serve as a platform to provide
academic and community recognition of efforts from open-source contributors in the field.
We will bring together machine learning researchers, engineers,
industrial practitioners, and software development experts.
The workshop will feature invited talks, panel discussions with experts,
and extended abstract submissions from open-source contributors in machine learning.

## Call for Papers

We welcome submissions on open-source software within the context of machine learning research. We encourage all types of contributions, including research papers, position papers, technical reports, and retrospectives. 

**Suggested topics** include:

-   Submissions that describe a new open-source machine learning software library
-   Submissions which explain a new addition, significant bug fixes, or changes to an established library
-   Submissions that explore a scientific result across different versions of an (established) library
-   Submissions on the technical setup (e.g. CI, testing) and best practices for reproducibility
-   Proposals for better workflows or incentives for open-source development and maintenance in ML
-   Retrospectives on the development and maintenance of mature ML OSS packages

_We especially encourage submissions on development practices, mature libraries, and other topics that have received little recognition from traditional academic venues_.

As our proceedings are non-archival, we will accept work that is under submission or recently accepted by other publication venues (e.g. NeurIPS, JMLR OSS Track, etc.)

### Submission Guidelines

We invite submissions of **4-page workshop papers** (excluding references and appendix) that address any of the workshop themes. Submissions should use the **[ICML style file](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2025/AuthorInstructions)**. We encourage submissions to include relevant links to projects wherever applicable (we recommend using [Anonymous4OpenScience](https://anonymous.4open.science/) to hide identifying details). We discourage lengthy appendices as reviewers are not required to read them.

**[Submit Paper on OpenReview >>](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/CODEML)**

Submissions will undergo a double-blind review process for relevance and adherence to ICML's academic integrity standards. We recognize that it may be impossible for some submissions to be truly anonymous (e.g., a retrospective on a widely used library), so we ask authors to use their best judgment regarding potentially identifying details.

We aim to be inclusive while ensuring high-quality discussions that align with the workshop's objectives. To that end, papers will be reviewed under the [TMLR criteria](https://jmlr.org/tmlr/acceptance-criteria.html):

1.  **Correctness:** Are the claims made in the submission supported by accurate, convincing and clear evidence?
2.  **Audience:** Would some individuals in the workshop's audience be interested in the findings of this submission?

Accepted submissions will be presented during joint poster sessions and made publicly available as non-archival reports, allowing future submissions to archival conferences or journals. 

### Camera-Ready Submission
For the camera-ready version of accepted papers, please use [this style file](https://github.com/codeml-workshop/codeml2025/blob/main/_data/icml_codeml_2025.sty) which serves as a drop-in replacement of the ICML style file. Camera-ready papers may have *five* pages of main content (one additional from the submission page limit).
